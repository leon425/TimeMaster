create new app:
python manage.py startapp register
create the urls for register page (a simple path)

go to views.py and import: (Because django provides a user registrattion form)
from django.contrib.auth import login, authenticate
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

# Modifiy the UserCreationForm: 
create form.py in register dir
create a class that inherit UserCreationForm

# Design the regisration page
pip install django-crispy-forms     # automatic styling for forms
Go to settings.py and add crispy forms to INSTALLED_APPS    ->    "crispy_forms"

CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK="bootstrap5"  on settings.py  # Which frame work does the crispy forms use
In register.html -> {% load crispy_forms_tags %}   #(To use crispy forms)

{{form|crispy}}  # Its a filter to do a styling into the form

Django already built a lof of built in pages, like login, logout, change password

# Create a login page:
create login.html 
modify urls.py ->  path('', include("django.contrib.auth.urls")), # django will get to django.contrib.auth application and go to urls file # Create login page automatically
In settings.py -> LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/"   # Redirect us to home page when done logging in
                  LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/"

By default, when we go to Django, it has a user attribute. When there is no user signed in, its anonymus user and user.is_authenticated == False.


Go to base2.html and add:  # to display things that only logged in users can see.
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
{% endif %}

response.user = Getting the user.
