# Configure the static files in settings.py

STATIC_URL = '/static/' #by default, Django already know the url path is /static/
STATICFILES_DIRS = [ # tell django where our folders sits 
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static') # BASE_DIR is specified earlier in settings.py. 'static' is the static folder name.
] 

# Go to your HTML templates
{% load static %} <!---->

# Media Files (For any kind of images or videos)


Create a media folder and inside it, create a new folder for images and videos.

# in models.py
create a new imageField :   venue_image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True, upload_to="images/") #inside the media directory, 
                                            there will be a subdirectory called images where all the images will be saved

if you want to display image: HomePage.objects.get(id=1).card_image.url

# in settings.py configure it by:
MEDIA_URL =  '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') #the location of media file. media is the name of the folder
